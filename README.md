# Is It Friday?

**Is It Friday?** is a deliberately over-engineered, dramatically presented static web page designed to answer a single critical question:

> **Is it Friday?**

## Features

* Dropdown menu to select any day of the week
* Instant, cutting‑edge Friday detection technology
* Cosmic‑level confirmation or denial
* Fully static — no backend, no databases, no AI, no servers

## Demo

Select a day.
Click **Verify**.
Discover whether the universe acknowledges Friday.

## Why This Exists

Because determining whether it is Friday shouldn't require time, calendars, or logic. It should require a dramatic, neon‑green interface and an unnecessarily serious tone.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in any browser.

If it says it's Friday — celebrate.
If not — accept disappointment with dignity.
